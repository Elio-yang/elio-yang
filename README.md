### Hi! I'm Yang Yang 👋

I am currently a PhD student @UVA CS. 

I am interested in performance issues in GPU × Trusted Computing × Cryptography × Memory

Recently, I have focused on understanding and addressing performance issues (e.g., data movement [ISCA'25]) in secure GPU architectures like confidential computing [ISPASS'25, +].

I am also interested in making cryptographic protocols (e.g., PIR and FHE) more practical using GPUs.
